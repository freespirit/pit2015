# pit2015
A simple project that attempts to solve Task 1 from SemEval 2015 - Paraphrases in Twitter (whether 2 sentences from Twitter imply the same meaning). It's used for educational purposes and did not participate in the competition.

The program uses 2 models for classification - linear regression and fuzzy k means. The model's output is used as a semantic similarity score and each pair of sentences is labeled (as paraphrase or none) based on that score.
